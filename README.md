# Hack-indore (SMART BIN)
SGSITS HACKINDORE HACKATHON IMAGE CLASSIFICATION MODEL AND DATASET

This project was developed in HackIndore 2.0 Hackathon. I was responsible for creating the neural net for this project and all things related to data preparation and model deployment. We created an android app which enables the user to take an image of some garbage and classify it as solid or wet garbage using a Resnet-32 neural net. This app can be used by the municipal corporations of cities and the core of this project can be used by connecting it to all the cctv cameras in the city and creating a map of the garbage in the city.
